qttirc stands for Qt+Twisted IRC. I thought the existence of a free GUI IRC client (or any at all) written in Python was sorely lacking out there. 

It's not really finished, it's very rudimentary. It doesn't even have configuration dialogs yet, for example. 

My project qtpyirc is a version of this I wrote in 2009 and lost for many years, then found again after I'd started over from scratch already and made this version. 

There may be files included that aren't really necessary for the project. I'm not even sure if all the files included are legal for me to distribute. Owel.

It uses t.i.p.irc, but with some custom modifications to irc.py that the program relies on, hence the inclusion of irc.py in the repository.
